# Password Management Page by Kavruk



## Introduction

Welcome to the **Password Management Page** project, created by Kavruk. This project is a simple password management application built using Python, PyQt5 (a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces), and a DBMS (Database Management System). The purpose of this application is to help users securely store and manage their passwords.

To run the project, you need to execute the `password.py` file, which is the main Python script of the application. This file contains the code responsible for launching the graphical user interface and interacting with the database.

## Features

- Securely store and manage your passwords.
- User-friendly graphical user interface.
- Support for adding, updating, and deleting passwords.
- Encrypted storage of passwords in the database.
- Easy-to-use interface for quick access to stored passwords.
